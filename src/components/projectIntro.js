                    There is no greater feeling than the satisfaction of a job well done, being able to create new and engaging projects for myself and others from the ground up is what keeps me motivated. I pride myself on my ability to take an idea from an inspired thought, to pen and paper, to whiteboard, then from my screen and on to yours! Each project is an opportunity to experiment with new methods and technologies and to sharpen my skills not only as a developer, but as a creative.

                    Below are some prime examples of projects i've taken from their conception in my own imagination to a functional application out on the internet!
